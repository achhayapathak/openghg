OpenGHG
============

OpenGHG is a project to create a platform for collaboration for researchers, stakeholders and the public
within the realm of greenhouse gases. The platform is built on open source technologies :doc:`technologies <technologies>`
to create a cloud agnostic platform for simulation and analysis of large datasets.

Background
=====================

OpenGHG will primarily be based in the cloud but can also be used locally to handle the processing and 
storage of data within a local object store. See the :doc:`local use section <localuse>`.
