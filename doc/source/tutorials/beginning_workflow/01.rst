===================
Beginner workflow
===================

This tutorial assumes that you have installed ``openghg``. To ensure install has been successful you can open an ``ipython``
console and import openghg

.. code-block:: bash
    ipython

    import openghg
    print(openghg.__version__)

If you get an ``ImportError`` please go back to the :doc:`install section <../../install>`.

This tutorial is written for ``openghg`` version |version| or higher. If you are using an older
version then please upgrade (see :ref:`Installation instructions:Upgrade`).

Notebooks
=========

In this tutorial we'll make use of a Jupyter notebook file ``start.ipynb`` that can be found in the ``users/tutorials/beginning_workflow`` 
directory in the root directory of the OpenGHG repository.


.. note:: For anyone new to notebooks see `this introduction <https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/>`_.
