Fn usage
--------

We're now going to build on what we covered in the :doc:`fn_devel` section. We'll cover calling OpenGHG
functions using the classes available in the ``openghg.client`` module. Using these classes we can do things
like upload data, search for data on the OpenGHG Cloud and perform data analysis on that data.

As this is the developent documentatio we will cover some lower level usage of these functions.

Firstly we'll look at the Search class.
