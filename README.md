## OpenGHG - a cloud platform for greenhouse gas data analysis and collaboration

OpenGHG is a project based on the prototype [HUGS platform](https://www.hugs-cloud.com) which aims to be a platform for collaboration and analysis
of greenhouse gas (GHG) data.

The platform will be built on open-source technologies and will allow researchers to collaborate on large datasets by harnessing the
power and scalability of the cloud.

For more information please see [our documentation](https://docs.openghg.org/).
