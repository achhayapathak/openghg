# Keying for the object store

DataSource - can be a particular site/instrument/height
These can then be identified by Site, instrument etc

/data/uid/{datasource_uid}

Can then key the data

/data/uid/{datasource_uid}/{datestart_dateend}

/datasource/uid/{uid}

This returns information regarding that datasource

To get all the DataSources related to an instrument

/instruments/uid/{instrument_id}/datasources

Then for instruments

/instruments/uid/{instrument_uid}

This returns a JSON containing the UIDs of all the DataSources provided by the instrument

Each time we want to create a DataSource object we call the DataSouce.create function and pass in the information
from the calling Instrument etc, which in turn holds all the site and network data which can be passed down.




Then for sites

/site/uid/{site_uid}

This returns a JSON of all the UIDs of the instruments provided by the instrument

Then for networks

/networks/uid/{network_uid}

This gives the JSOON that describes the network, including all the Instruments for that network

We should also be able to lookup the networks and instruments by name

/instruments/name/{encdoded_name}

This would then return a JSON containing information regarding that instrument including its UID, full name, location, network etc
