Check the performance warning

/home/gar/Documents/Devel/hugs/modules/_datasource.py:167: PerformanceWarning: 
  your performance may suffer as PyTables will pickle object types that it cannot
  map directly to c-types [inferred_type->mixed-integer,key->axis0] [items->None]
  
    out["data"] = self._data

Check the conversion of a Pandas Timestamp object to string and then to python datetime object 
by the Acquire functions
